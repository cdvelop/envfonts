Cross-environment font manager for Go (backend, frontend with WebAssembly/syscall/js)


`envfonts` is a lightweight and extensible Go library for managing fonts across different environments, including backend systems and frontend applications compiled to WebAssembly using `syscall/js`.

Designed with cross-platform flexibility in mind, `envfonts` abstracts font loading, access, and listing to provide a unified API whether you're running Go on a server, in a CLI tool, or in the browser.

## Features

- Unified API for font discovery and usage across environments
- WebAssembly support via `syscall/js` for font access in browsers
- Simple integration with custom rendering engines or PDF generators
- Zero dependencies and minimal footprint

## Use Cases

- Embed fonts into WASM-based frontend UIs
- Dynamically list available fonts on server or client
- Select and load fonts consistently across platforms
